# Metabolic pathway analysis for Reactome pathways

**Input:** High-throughput metabolite levels for condition and control samples

**Output:** Ranked list of Reactome pathways that perturbed in the condition under study â€“ the rank is based on a score or p-value that results from evaluating the pathway disruption given the data and the pathway information from the Reactome database
